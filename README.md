# Music-Recommendation-System
Music-Recommendation-System In this project, we analyzed sequential patterns of songs userwise. We took One Hot, Word2Vec and Bert word embeddings and used as an input representation of words. Finally, we made Horizontal CNN and Vertical CNN and concatenated them to get our final results.
